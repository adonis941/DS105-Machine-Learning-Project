# DS105-Machine-Learning-Project
# This is a simple machine learning project to practice and apply my knowledge of what I have learned during my beginner's course on machine learning
# For this project, I built a LSTM machine learning model to try to predict future cryptocurrency prices and trends. I focused specifically on Bitcoin and Ethereum here.
# My presentation on my findings and the respective coding for Bitcoin & Ethereum are contained within this repository
